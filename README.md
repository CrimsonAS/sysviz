# sysviz

sysviz is a UI for presenting data from ftrace-based traces from Linux systems.
It also includes basic support for representing the addtional systrace-based
data pioneered by Android, which represents some additional information about
what userspace applications are doing (in the form of call stacks, or counters,
etc).

# thanks to
